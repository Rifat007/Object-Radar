# Object-Radar
A project using Atmega32 micro-controller

This project is based on the measuring of distance by a Ultrasonic Sensor.
The sensor will set up on a servo motor and the motor will rotate 360 degree
by 45 degree delay. For Different position the sensor will detect object from the
sensor and show the distance on the LCD display and map the position on
the Dot Matrix. As a result we can show the existence of the obstacles.
